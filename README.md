Common Mistakes:

Code Readability is to be taken care of. Use valid naming conventions and comment lines for better understanding of code.
Expected .java file but .txt file is pushed to git.

Review for 2nd Program:

Static keyword for a function and a variable is to be avoided.


Review for 5th Program:

The code written is for O(n^2). Try doing it in O(n).
